Understanding Express Entry

Canada’s Express Entry system is one of the most efficient and popular immigration routes for skilled workers hoping to become permanent residents. Managed by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), it uses a points-based Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) to evaluate applicants based on age, education, language skills, work experience, and more. It is not a program itself but a management system for three core economic immigration streams: Federal Skilled Worker (FSW), Canadian Experience Class (CEC), and Federal Skilled Trades (FST). Candidates create an online profile, receive a CRS score, and if they rank high enough, they may receive an Invitation to Apply (ITA) for permanent residence. This guide explains how Express Entry works and outlines clear, practical ways to increase your score.

What is Express Entry?

Express Entry is Canada’s flagship application management system for skilled immigrants. It governs three main programs:

1. Federal Skilled Worker (FSW): For people with skilled work experience gained abroad.
2. Canadian Experience Class (CEC): For those with skilled work experience in Canada.
3. Federal Skilled Trades (FST): For applicants qualified in a skilled trade, often with a job offer or trade certification in Canada.

Instead of waiting in line, applicants enter a pool and are ranked using the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS). Top candidates receive ITAs during regular draws. The system is merit-based, dynamic, and transparent.

How the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) Works

CRS evaluates candidates using a maximum score of 1200 points. The breakdown is as follows:

* Core human capital factors (up to 600 points): Age, education, language ability, and work experience.
* Additional points (up to 600 points): Provincial nominations, French/English bilingual ability, Canadian education, siblings in Canada, and more.

Key Factors That Affect Your Score:

* Age: Maximum points are awarded to applicants aged 20–29. Points decline with age beyond this range.
* Education: Higher education credentials lead to more points. Canadian education offers bonus points.
* Work Experience: Canadian and foreign skilled work counts, but Canadian experience has higher value.
* Language Proficiency: Proficiency in English and/or French is heavily rewarded. Achieving CLB 9+ in IELTS or equivalent can unlock bonus points.
* Additional Factors: Having a sibling in Canada, being bilingual, or receiving a provincial nomination can significantly improve your CRS score.

What’s New in 2023–2025

Category-Based Draws: Introduced in 2023, these allow IRCC to invite candidates based on occupation or language skills rather than CRS score alone. Categories include:

* Healthcare
* STEM
* Skilled Trades
* French Language Proficiency
* Agriculture and Agri-Food
* Education (added in 2025)

Job Offer Points Removed: As of March 2025, valid job offers no longer add CRS points. While job offers are helpful for certain PNPs and program eligibility, they no longer directly boost Express Entry rankings.

Greater Emphasis on Canadian Experience: CEC candidates are seeing more frequent draws, with the government signalling continued preference for those with Canadian work backgrounds.

How to Increase Your CRS Score

Improve Language Scores:
Language ability is one of the most impactful ways to raise your CRS score. Many candidates see substantial gains by preparing for and retaking IELTS/CELPIP or adding French proficiency. For example, achieving CLB 9 unlocks skill transferability bonus points.

Gain More Work Experience:
More skilled work years, especially in Canada, can increase your score. Canadian work experience often gives more weight than foreign experience, so continuing to work in a skilled role can pay off over time.

Boost Educational Credentials:
Completing higher or additional education, including Canadian degrees or diplomas, adds points. Ensure all existing credentials are evaluated through an Educational Credential Assessment (ECA).

Apply for a Provincial Nominee Program (PNP):
A provincial nomination adds 600 points to your CRS score, nearly guaranteeing an ITA. Explore enhanced PNP streams aligned with Express Entry in Ontario, Alberta, and Nova Scotia.

Leverage Spousal Factors:
If you have a spouse, consider who should be the principal applicant. The spouse’s language scores, education, and experience can also add points. Sometimes, temporarily listing a spouse as non-accompanying can increase the applicant’s score.

Stay Informed and Keep Your Profile Updated:
Please update your Express Entry profile with any changes: new education, updated language scores, additional work experience, or a change in marital status. Regular updates keep your profile competitive.

Lived Insight: The Story of Sam and Priya

Sam and Priya, two international students in Alberta, began their Express Entry journey in 2023. Sam started with a CRS of 445. After improving his IELTS score and gaining one year of Canadian work experience, his CRS rose to 475. He received an ITA during a STEM-targeted draw. Priya later received a provincial nomination from Alberta, pushing her score above 470. Today, they’re both PRs, building a life in Canada and mentoring others. Their story shows that persistence, strategy, and timing can turn your dream into reality.
