The stands at Terry Fox Stadium shook with pride and excitement as Nigeria’s Green Falcons made history on Canadian soil, becoming the first African team to reach the Women’s Rugby League World Series Final.

Fresh off a determined 10–0 victory over Ireland, powered by Fedelia Omoghan’s early try and Rachel Iliya’s brilliant 80-metre finish, the Falcons stepped onto the field tonight carrying the hopes of a continent and the cheers of a passionate diaspora crowd.

The Final: Courage Meets Experience

From kickoff, the energy was electric. Nigeria tackled with heart, fought for every metre, and stood fearless against a seasoned Fiji side. The stadium echoed with drums, chants, and gasps with every defensive stand.

Despite Nigeria’s grit and spirit, Fiji’s experience showed, securing a 62–4 win and the 2025 World Series title. Yet the final whistle brought tears, pride, and thunderous applause, not disappointment.

More Than a Scoreline

The Falcons may not have lifted the trophy, but they lifted a continent’s belief.

A team built on determination, sacrifice, and raw talent stood on one of rugby league’s biggest stages and proved they belong. In Canada, they made history. Around the world, they inspired a generation.

A Moment for Africa, for Canada, and for Women’s Sport

“We came here to prove something,” said head coach Bolu Fagborun. “This is only the beginning.”

Fijian coach Josaia Dakuitoga agreed, “Nigeria will be back. You can feel the fire.”

This wasn’t just a game. It was a milestone, a movement, and a message. The future of women’s rugby now stretches proudly between Lagos and Toronto, Abuja and Brampton, Africa and North America.

Tonight, the Green Falcons didn’t just play. They changed the story.
