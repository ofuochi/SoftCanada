Toronto has no shortage of art events, but some moments hit differently. Narratives of the Diaspora turned a private home into a living gallery, pulling the city’s creative crowd into a space that felt more like a conversation than an exhibition. Curated by Zviko Mhakayakora and designed by Temi Akintan, the three-day salon stretched from October 3 to 5 and carried the kind of energy that lives beyond the night.

### A Space Where Stories Move

Inside the Akintan residence, walls breathed with bold colour, textured canvases, and layered histories. Guests didn’t just look at art. They walked through stories. There was no distance between artist and audience, no sterile white cube. It felt personal. It felt like memory. Bode Akintan, the host, put it simply. “This journey of collecting Black stories has always been personal. But each encounter, each brushstroke and bold visual story, reminds me that these aren’t just my stories. They belong to all of us.”The night was charged with quiet power. Laughter. Stillness. Soft conversation between strangers who understood the weight of shared history.

### Two Artists. One Conversation.

At the core of the salon were two voices shaping the dialogue: Ibe Ananaba and Kemi Sijuwade. Ananaba brought his signature intensity, rooted in a global journey that spans Belgium, Nigeria and Nova Scotia. Known for blending illustration, painting and design into work that explores contemporary life, his pieces demand attention. Sijuwade brought a different kind of force. Her work radiates softness and layered intimacy. It lingers in the room long after the conversation moves on. Together, they created a sonic and visual balance that felt less like a showcase and more like a dialogue between two visions.

### The Pulse of a Moment

Narratives of the Diaspora was more than an event. It was a cultural signal. A reminder that art isn’t just for looking. It’s for feeling. It’s for remembering. It’s for reclaiming the stories that shape who we are and where we’re going. For Toronto’s African diaspora, this was a night that carried weight. For the city, it was proof that culture moves fastest when it’s personal.
